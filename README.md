# Claude Code Stats

A native macOS menu bar app that displays your Claude Code usage limits in real-time.

## Features

- **Real-time usage data** - Shows your actual usage from Anthropic's servers
- **Current Session** - 5-hour rolling window usage with reset countdown
- **Weekly Limits** - All models combined usage with reset time
- **API-equivalent spend** - What your token usage would have cost at API rates: today, the last 7 days, and month to date, with a per-model breakdown and a 30-day chart you can hover for any day's figure. Read from Claude Code's own transcripts on disk, so it needs no extra tooling and makes no network calls
- **RTK savings** - If you run your dev commands through RTK (Rust Token Killer), shows how many tool-output tokens it kept out of Claude Code's context: today, the last 7 days, and month to date, plus a lifetime total, an average-reduction meter, and an API-equivalent value range. The range spans a conservative floor (each saved token priced once) and an optimistic ceiling (adding the re-billing an unfiltered result would incur, scaled by your own observed cache re-read rate). Read from RTK's local history database, so it appears only when RTK is installed and makes no network calls
- **Auto-refresh** - Updates every 5 minutes automatically
- **Claude service status** - Live status from [status.claude.com](https://status.claude.com) shown in the footer (Operational, Degraded, Outage, Critical)
- **Version update detection** - Checks for new Claude Code releases hourly via GitHub; shows a red dot badge on the menu bar icon and a banner when an update is available, with a link to the changelog
- **Trace** - How Cloudflare sees your connection to Claude: country (with flag), edge datacentre, public IP, negotiated HTTP/TLS/key exchange, and whether WARP is on. Useful for checking which region Claude is serving you from. Your IP is masked until you click it, and the whole card — including its request — can be switched off in Settings
- **Native macOS app** - Built with SwiftUI, lightweight and fast
- **Light/dark theme** - Follows macOS appearance, or pin it to Light or Dark in Settings

## Requirements

- macOS 14.0 (Sonoma) or later
- Active Claude Pro/Max subscription
- Claude Code installed and logged in

## Installation

### Option 1: Homebrew (Recommended)

```bash
brew tap dmelo/tap
brew install --cask claude-code-stats
```

### Option 2: Download Release

Download the latest `.app` from the [Releases](https://github.com/dmelo/claude-code-stats/releases) page and drag it to your Applications folder.

### Option 3: Build from Source

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dmelo/claude-code-stats.git
   cd claude-code-stats
   ```

2. Open in Xcode:
   ```bash
   open ClaudeCodeStats/ClaudeCodeStats.xcodeproj
   ```

3. Build and run (⌘R)

## Setup

1. Make sure Claude Code is installed and you're logged in (`claude` in your terminal)
2. Launch the app - a chart icon will appear in your menu bar
3. Click the icon to see your usage data

The app reads your OAuth credentials from `~/.claude/.credentials.json` or the macOS Keychain (created automatically when you log in to Claude Code). No manual configuration needed.

## Usage

Click the menu bar icon to see your current usage:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Current Session** | Usage in the current 5-hour window |
| **Weekly Limit** | Combined usage across all models (resets weekly) |

The progress bars change color based on usage:
- 🟢 Green: 0-50%
- 🟡 Yellow: 50-75%
- 🔴 Red: 75-100%

## Start at Login

To launch automatically when you log in:

1. Open **System Settings** → **General** → **Login Items**
2. Click **+** and add ClaudeCodeStats

## Building

```bash
cd ClaudeCodeStats
xcodebuild -project ClaudeCodeStats.xcodeproj -scheme ClaudeCodeStats -configuration Release build
```

The built app will be in `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/ClaudeCodeStats-*/Build/Products/Release/`

## Privacy

- The app reads OAuth credentials from `~/.claude/.credentials.json` or the macOS Keychain (no secrets are stored by the app itself)
- The app communicates with the Anthropic API to fetch usage data, status.claude.com for service health, the GitHub API for version checks, and claude.ai/cdn-cgi/trace for the Trace card — four hosts, all plain GETs, none of which receive anything about your usage. Turning the Trace card off in Settings stops that fourth request entirely
- API-equivalent spend and RTK savings are computed entirely on your machine from Claude Code's transcripts and RTK's local history database — no network calls, and nothing about your usage leaves your device
- The app never runs a shell or sources your shell startup files; the installed CLI version is read from files on disk
- No data is sent to any third parties
